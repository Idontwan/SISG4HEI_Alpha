# SISG4HEI_Alpha
**The alpha version of simulated indoor scenario generator for houses with elderly individuals.**

## Summary
SISG4HEI_Alpha generate virtual indoor spatial, travel pattern and activity schedule data, and coverts these data to simulated PIR sensor records and scenarios files of Stage and Gazebo.

This project demostrates the codes and outputs of SISG4HEI_Alpha. Generated indoor spatial, travel pattern and activity schedule data are in SISG4HEI_Alpha/Database; simulated PIR sensor records and scenarios files of Stage and Gazebo are in SISG4HEI_Alpha/Outputs.

## Running Environment
1. You can run these codes on Linux. If you want to run them on Windows, change all "/" in all Logical Block Addresses to "\\".
2. Need Python3.
3. Need Libraries such as numpy, json, matplotlib, PIL, tkinter

## Instruction
Run SISG4HEI_Alpha/Outputs/GUI/GUI_Base.py, then follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1_bpkHulO0).
